3. If not they shall flip over again after a short period of time, allowing the user to memorise them
4. The number of frogs awarded to the player is calculated from the number of moves taken
4. Time taken by the player is tracked thoughout the game
5. If all the cards are matched within the time limit, the game is won. Time taken, moves and frogs awarded are displayed at the end
